Super Ass Brothers: Remasstered is here (kinda)!

Glad you could make it, friend. If you're seeing this you are one of Super Ass Brothers: Remasstered's (codenamed SAB 2) beta testers.

To play the game, 
- Go to https://github.com/AshQuimby/SAB-2/releases.
- Download the most recent version.
- Open the folder and double-click the file sharing the name of the operating system you use (currently only tested for Windows).
- Navigate the menus with arrow-keys, enter and escape.
- In-game player 1 is controlled with WASD and F to attack/select, player 2 is arrow-keys and M to attack/select.

To report bugs, seeing as there aren't enough beta testers for a formal system, just send them to the discord server or DM AshQuimby or a_viper to get them fixed.

To request balance changes follow the same procedure as bug reporting.

Campaign is not currently complete, net code is not currently complete, and not all characters have programmed AIs, but that can't stop you from doing it anyways :D.
