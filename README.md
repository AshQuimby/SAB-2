## <i>Super Ass Brothers: Remasstered</i> is here! (kinda)
---

### Glad you could make it, friend. If you're seeing this you are one of Super Ass Brothers: Remasstered's (codenamed SAB 2) beta testers.

#### To play the game:
- Go to https://github.com/AshQuimby/SAB-2/releases.
- Download the most recent version.
- Open the folder and double-click the file telling you to click it.
- Navigate the menus with arrow-keys, enter and escape.
- In-game player 1 is controlled with WASD and F to attack/select, player 2 is arrow-keys and M to attack/select.

To report bugs, seeing as there aren't enough beta testers for a formal system, just send them to the discord server or DM AshQuimby or a_viper to get them fixed.

To request balance changes follow the same procedure as bug reporting.

### Notes
Campaign is not currently complete. <br>
Net code is not currently complete. <br>
Not all characters have programmed AIs. <br>
This is a passion project, do not expect us to treat it like a job. <br>
Modloader is being worked on tentatively in the background. Hopefully I can get auto-updating and a better release pipeline up :/
